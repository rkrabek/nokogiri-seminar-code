Mid-80's or late-80's Schwinn Tempo complete bicycle with some decent parts (e.g. Campi rear derailleur). Bike was put together by a man into cycling who built this for his son, using whatever half-decent parts he had around. It's all 80's technology. That guy's son is a friend of mine who gave me the bike in great condition, though it's been sitting around for so many years that the rubber needs to be replaced--one tube won't hold air so you won't be able to test ride it unless you want to come change a tube.

Size: from middle of crank spindle to the midpoint of top-tube joining seat tube is 20.5"".

You'd have to come pick it up.
